# MTH510
My work for MTH510 - Numerical Analysis. 

Course Description:
Review of Taylor's formula, truncation error and round off error. Solutions of Non linear Equations in one variable. Linear Equations. LU-decomposition. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel methods. Interpolation and curve fitting. Numerical integration. Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. (Initial value problems.)

GitHub Repo Description:
Concepts taught in MATLAB. I try to implement some of these concepts in C++ during my free time.
Applications of Numerical Analysis include: 
Machine Learning, Healthcare & Medicine, Finance, Engineering, and Statistics, and more.
